### Hey there, I'm Cory ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **backend Ruby developer** with over a year of commercial experience. So far I've been focusing on writing Ruby/Rails code on the backend, but am currently catching up on the frontend (JS and React). Excited about Domain-Driven Design and Event Sourcing, but always enjoy learning and applying new design patterns to meet project needs.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Domain Driven Design, how to optimize Rails, and SQL**
- ðŸ’¬ Let's chat about **Ruby and Ruby on Rails**
- ðŸ“« You can reach me **c.streiff@pm.me**
